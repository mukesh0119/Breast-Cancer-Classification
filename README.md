# Breast-Cancer-Classification
Breast Cancer Classification using Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression 

Breast Cancer Data Set
The breast cancer data set contains descriptors of cell nuclei generated from images
of tissue samples, along with an indication of the class, which describes whether the
cells are benign or malignant.

The attributes in the dataset are:

• Cl.thickness - Clump Thickness

• Cell.size - Uniformity of Cell Size

• Cell.shape - Uniformity of Cell Shape

• Marg.adhesion - Marginal Adhesion

• Epith.c.size - Single Epithelial Cell Size

• Bare.nuclei - Bare Nuclei

• Bl.cromatin - Bland Chromatin

• Normal.nucleoli - Normal Nucleoli

• Mitoses - Mitoses

• Class - Class


The task is to apply and evaluate classification methods on this data using a Naïve
Bayes model, and a logistic regression model, to predict the class based on the
measurements
